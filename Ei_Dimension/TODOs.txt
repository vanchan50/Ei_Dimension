Ctrl+F every "Path." and "Environment." for irrelevant paths
Need some way to update Device.MapCtroller.MapList if we get to add new maps
When something from Settings changes, use .Save() and don't forget to change App.[property]
Save settings from textboxes in App.InjectToTextbox()
ResultsView scatter chart switch legend with buttons so it can be bound to command

ComponentsView SamplingON button - change behaviour like GetPosition Toggle button. for language swapping
AlignmentVM LastCalibratedPosition no implementation in legacy; Auto Align - no Run button implementation, and for some reason turns off LED's

App.InjectToTextbox() needs cleanup after it is finished
If "." is inserted into texbox that is meant to be for INT, round down/ make some alert/<<< or don't accept the ".">>> do that after
  cleaning up the App.InjectToTextbox()

GetProperty still goes to textboxupdater and changes properties
SetProperty goes same way and double time sets UI parameters

Fix bug with select all button in WellSelectView

Display a tab related to work order execution where you touch a well
  and all that wells properties (read speed, sample volume, bead map, etc) are displayed,
  During execution, highlight well currently reading and currently aspirating, updating properties as wells are read

The commands that change the dropdown state are legacy from keeping parameters in the firmware, same goes for initStab
  Can remove that and use Settings

what does chart2.Series["CLTARGET"].Enabled mean? another chart displayed? ---> CalibrationVM CalibrationSelector()

PlateReport class has useless members except list

Subtract bed region background button. useless?

Switch language should account for selected settings in device. like for ChannelsVM

resultsVM has obscollections of obsobjects. can ez be translated to arrays[obsobjects], so obscollection not neeeded?

TimerTick looks like not the best option. should be used only to update UI. program logic should be on a separate thread?

case "ClassificationTargetsContents": (CalibrationView Classification Targets)
  Save Calibration to current map button is viable?

Device.TerminationReadyCheck() case 1
  looks wrong. don't copy EndRead button function here? why not?

ResultsVM.SetDisplayedMap() can be optimised

MicroCyDevice.IsNewWorkOrder() is crazy, since it is checked by app.TimerTick every tick. should be put on file watcher

sampling button on ComponentsView could have an issue

make an Installer
mouse select doesn't work, from selected single well

trycatch on disconnect doen'st work

template select with finger problematic?

put outdir to settings? could be eh for usb sticks

  filters:                                done?
  1st one - don't save this bead record   done?
  2nd - still report it                   done?
  3rd postponed                           done?

ActiveRegionsStatsHandler could use a Span<T> instad of array allocation

sorting DisplayedMap is evil, since there is a high chancem that some other thread is working with it. even for backingMap

WellResults cause a bunch of Multithreaded issues, I might look for another approach instead


--------------------------------------------------------
open another endpoint in usb?

none/daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly

case 0x1b: what happens earlier message or endOfMeasurement? if latter - can lead to bug 

Cal should calculate and save the DNR coefficient by dividing the median Green Minor by media Green Major, i.e. the high sensitivity channel by the other green channel
----
val mode
map centers should be real values? not binned. probably

Validator doesn't capture the beads nearby; make regions ~ 4 times bigger size?
right now it analyzes base only on beads registered to region. Result makes no sense anyway

--------------------------------------------------------
!!!!!map paraameters don't load on startup. need to switch maps for it to work
in non-touch mode, pressing a button does not trigger sanity check,leading to losing input data, without checking. pressing enter does help, but this has to work

ReplyFromMC should just fill a FIFO. don't do any processing in that function
Move that processing to the other project?

???????????????
NavigateCalibration()
  InitStab() happens during the run. WTF????

  StartingToReadEventHandler has comments for multitube logic
